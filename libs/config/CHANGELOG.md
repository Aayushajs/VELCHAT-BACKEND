# @velchat/config

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- d9578ad: API gateway is now a real edge: reverse-proxy routing to every backend service (ordered rules resolve
  the /users and /conversations prefixes that are shared across services), auth/tenant header
  pass-through, per-IP rate limiting, and clean 502s. CORS is enabled on all services via CORS_ORIGINS
  (added a pre-listen `configure` hook to bootstrapService) so web/desktop clients work out of the box.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Phase 8/9 features: AI translation service (cache + language prefs), automation-service (bots, slash
  commands, workflows, reminders, durable job runner), chat polls, mail campaigns + branded templates,
  FCM push routing, and env-driven integration scripts.
